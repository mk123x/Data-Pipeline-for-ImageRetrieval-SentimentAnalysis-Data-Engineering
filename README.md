# Data-Engineering
Data Engineering project on unstructured image and text data pipeline for content-based image retrieval and sentiment analysis

This repository contains my coursework for the Data Engineering module. The project demonstrates data engineering techniques by building two unstructured databases using Python: one for a content-based image retrieval system and another for sentiment analysis.

Libraries used:

- **`pandas`** – for loading, cleaning, and exploring structured datasets
  
- **`matplotlib`** – for generating visualisations and plots
  
- **`seaborn`** – for creating heatmaps to identify missing values 

Contents include:

-A full report detailing data sources, preprocessing steps, feature extraction, metadata management, and NoSQL database usage.

-A Python notebook for preprocessing and storing both image and text data.

-A folder containing the images and text data used in the project.


This project was completed as part of my second year Data Engineering module in the BSc Data Science and Analytics course at the University of Westminster.
